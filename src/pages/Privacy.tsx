          <p>
            Our data processing is subject to the principle that we only process
            the Personal Data that is necessary for the use of our services. In
            doing so, we take great care to ensure that your privacy and the
            confidentiality of all Personal Data are always guaranteed.
          </p>
          <p>
            All transmitted data is protected by TLS encryption. Transport Layer
            Security (TLS) is a protocol used to ensure secure data transmission
            on the Internet. The public-private key procedure is used here. This
            means that data encrypted with a publicly accessible key can only be
            decrypted again with a separate private key.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also use technical and organisational security measures (TOMs)
            throughout the company to protect the data we manage from you
            against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction or
            against access by unauthorised persons.

            or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its
            rectification, deletion, or object to its processing, please do so
            by contacting us.
          </p>
          <p>
            For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may
            ask you to provide proof of identity before we can answer the above
            requests. Please keep in mind, we may reject requests for certain
            reasons, including if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe
            on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy of another
            person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object
            to the processing of Personal Data, notably where such requests
            would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore.

            disclosing your Personal Data for any or all of the Purposes by
            submitting your request to us. Should you withdraw your consent to
            the collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Data, it may
            impact our ability to proceed with your transactions, agreements, or
            interactions with us. Please note that your withdrawal of consent
            will not prevent us from exercising our legal rights (including any
            remedies) or undertaking any steps as we may be entitled to at law.

              a court order, subpoena or search warrant, government/legal
              investigation, or other legal requirement; (ii) to assist in the
              prevention or detection of crime (in each case, subject to
              applicable law); or (iii) to protect the safety of any person.
            </li>
            <li>
              disclosure would reduce our liability in actual or threatened

              legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested
              parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; and (iv) to
              investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal
              activities, suspected fraud or other misconduct.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We may ask for your consent to share your information with third

            on our server provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in their London
            Location until the purpose for processing it no longer applies. If
            you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent
            to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other
            legally permissible reasons for storing your Personal Data (e.g.,
            retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case,
            the data will be deleted once these reasons no longer apply.

          <h4>Do you have to provide data?</h4>
          <p>
            The provision of both Personal Data and special category data is
            neither legally nor contractually required, nor is it necessary for
            the conclusion of a contract. You are also not obliged to provide
            the Personal Data. However, failure to provide the data could result
            in you not being able to use our APP or not being able to use it to
            its full extent. The legal basis for this data processing is
            consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may withdraw your consent and request us to stop using and/or

          <i>About our APP</i>

          <p>
            In principle, our APP is designed to have data protection-friendly
            default settings. This includes, for example, that only such
            Personal Data is collected that is required for the function of the
            APP (principle of data minimisation). As such we have made sure that
            as little as possible information that directly identifies you is
            collected.
          </p>
          <p>
            We assure you of the lawful and responsible handling of all data
            that you transmit to us as a user of our APP and would like to
            transparently present to you below which data we process, what we
            use it for and whether and, if so, to what extent it is stored by us
            and/or transmitted to third parties.

        <section>
          <h4>What sources and data do we use</h4>
          <p>
            We process Personal Data only to the extent authorised by you
            personally. In doing so, we only collect and process the data that
            is absolutely necessary to maintain and use the APP. Personal data
            may be collected in two ways, that is directly when you for example
            volunteer it to us or automatically for example when you install and
            use our APP.

          <p>
            If you send us feedback, or a support request, your e-mail address
            will only be used for correspondence with you and only to clarify
            your support case. Your data will not be passed on to third parties.
            The data of your request will be deleted after completion. In the
            course of the support you have requested, it may be necessary for
            you to provide us with some of your Personal Data so that we can
            fulfil our contractual obligations. The data transmitted in this
            context will be deleted after the end of the support. The legal
            basis for this processing is consent and our legitimate interest
            and, in some cases, fulfilment of our contractual obligations.

            using your email address and send you a One-time password (OTP).
          </p>
          <p>
            When using our APP, you can submit, share and publish Personal Data
            including pictures, image, photos, and free text submissions as well
            as your location. Some of the Personal Data you provide may be
            considered “special” or “sensitive”. This includes Personal Data
            concerning for example your health, racial or ethnic origins, sexual
            orientation, and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this
            data, you consent to our processing of that data.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            You have choices about the Personal Data you upload and share. You
            don’t have to provide Personal Data; however, Personal Data helps
            you to get more from our Services. It’s your choice whether to
            include special category data and to make that special category data
            public. Please do not post, upload or add data that you would not
            want to be available.
          </p>
          <p>
            The legal basis for the processing of your personal and special
            category data is the establishment and implementation of the user
            contract for the use of the service as well as your consent. We
            store the data until you delete your user account. Insofar as legal
            retention periods are to be observed, storage also takes place
            beyond the time of deletion of a user account.
          </p>

            You may withdraw your consent and request us to stop using and/or
